# Day 0: Tue. June 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Setup, and configuration, of this blog (lol). Doing a more thorough 101 of markdown, templating w/ ejs and swig, and a little CSS work on the portfolio site.

**Thoughts:** I struggled with how markdown is supposed to make me faster, but, overall, I know once I get it down I'm going to breeze through posts and focus on slowly getting better at it. The portfolio site showcases some good things, but still feel amateurish.  I worry I'm spending too much time there so tomorrow its back to the testing projects. 

**Link to work:** [Update Soon](http://www.example.com)

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
