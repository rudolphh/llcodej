# Day 0: Tue. June 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Setup, and configuration, of this blog (lol). Doing a more thorough 101 of markdown, templating w/ ejs and swig, and a little CSS work on the portfolio site.

**Thoughts:** Markdown is cool, and so is this theme; configuration takes some time but it's worth it in the scheme of things. This, and my portfolio are important which is why I consider them a part of this.

**Link to work:** [Update Soon](http://www.example.com)

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

**Today's Progress**: None, with moving and work. We gotta hit the restart on this

**Thoughts** We have to become more organized; probably more than I've ever been so its going to be a learning experience in much more than just code.
